albert einstein once said everybody's a genius but if you judge a fish it's ability to climb a tree it will live it's whole life believing that it is stupid ladies and gentlemen of the jewelry today on trial we have modern day schooling glad you could come not only does it make fish climb trees but also makes them climb down and do it ten mile run tell me school are you proud of the things you've done turning millions of people into robots do you find that fun do realize how many kids relate to that fish swimming upstream and class never finding their gifts thinking they are stupid believing they are useless but the time is called no more excuses call school to the stayed and accuse him of killing creativity individuality and being intellectually abuse if he's an ancient institution that has outlived his usage so your router this concludes my opening statement and if i may present the evidence of my case i will prove it proceed exhibit a is a modern day for recognize it is a fall for manager fifty years ago big difference right stayed with me here's a car from today and here's a car from one hundred and fifty years ago big difference right we'll get this is a classroom of today and here's a class we use one hundred and fifty years ago no way that a shape and literally more than a century nothing has changed yet you claim to prepare students for the future but whatever it is like that i must ask you prepare students for the future or the past i did a background check oh and you wouldn't let the record show that you were made to train people to work in factories which explains why you put students and straight rose nice and neat tell him sit still raise your hand if you want to speak of i'm a short break the for eight hours a day tell them what to think oh would make them compete to given a letter was determined product quality hence great a of meat i get it back then times with different we all have a past i myself or no god but today we don't need to make robots zombies the world has progressed and now we need people to be creative and innovative be critically independently would think ability to connect see every scientist will tell you that know to brains are the same in every parent would talk more children will confirm that claim so please explain why do tricks students like cookie cutter frames are snap back hats given them this one size fits all crap what truly sorry your honor what if a doctor prescribed the exact same medicine to all of his patients the results will be tragic so many people would get sick yet when it comes to school this is exactly what happens this educational malpractice where one teacher stands in front of twenty kids each one having different strains different nice different tips different dreams and you teach the same thing the same way that's horrific ladies and gentlemen the defendant should not be acquitted this may be one of the worst criminal offenses effort to be committed and this much in the way you treat your always objection overruled i it it's a shame i mean teachers have the most important job on the planet get under underpaid no wonder so many students a short changed this riyadh teachers should are just as much as doctors because a doctor can do heart surgery have saved the life of a kid but a great teacher can reach the heart of decade and allow him to truly live the teachers are heroes bit off the get blame but they're not the problem they work in a system without many additives all rights curriculums are created by policy makers most of which have never tolerate day in their life just obsessed with standardized tests reading bubble in a in a multiple choice question will determine success that's outlandish in fact these tests are to prove to be used as she'll be a bad and don't take my word for it take for jay kelly the man would be standardized testing to said and i hope these tests are to crew to be used and should be a baby ladies and gentlemen of the jewelry if we continue down this road the results are believed to i don't have much faith in school would i do have faith in people and if we can customize healthcare cars and facebook pages the is our duty to do the same for education to upgrade change it do away with school spirit because as useless unless we're working to bring the spirit each and every story that should be our task no more common core instead of this with the core of every hot in every class sure math is important but no more than our tour de sus game every just an equal share i know this sounds like a dream or countries like finland other one impressive phase they have shorter school days teachers make a decent wage homework is nonexistent and a focus on collaboration instead of competition but here's the kicker boys and girls their educational system outperformed every other country in the world other places like singapore succeeding rapidly schools like a montessori programs like khan academy there is no single solution but let's keep moving because while students maybe twenty percent of our population they are one hundred percent of our future solicited to their dreams and there's no telling where we can achieve this is a world in which i believe a world where fish are no longer forced to climb trees i rest my case
